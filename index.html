			<p class="mb-3 text-black">Building on previous successful DeepSpatial’20, DeepSpatial’21, and DeepSpatial’22 workshops at SIGKDD, we are proposing the 4th SIGKDD Workshop on Deep Learning for Spatio-temporal Data, Applications, and Systems (DeepSpatial’24) at the 30th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining as a full-day workshop. This year’s workshop features several new items, including emerging themes related to foundation models for spatiotemporal data and their interdisciplinary scientific applications, two distinguished keynote speakers, and two discussion panels on ongoing debates in the field.</p>

                                     <p class="mb-3 text-black"><font size="4">Climate change and pollutant emissions continue to worsen our breathing air, causing severe health problems for national and global citizens including ~ 10 million premature death annually and many more with relevant disease and longer term health impact. High resolution and fidelity data is desperately needed to support decision making to mitigate such health impact. Several questions that came to decision making need include a) how to better detect and forecast air quality events at community level, b) how to identify the correlation spatiotemporally between various breathing disease and the air quality patterns, c) how to develop relevant policies and a rapid response system that can help mitigate the impact of air pollution to the vulnerable communities to improve their resilience and sustainability. Taking these questions, this talk will introduce the popular air quality datasets, processing needs and the opportunities and challenges for machine learning such as research aspects of training datasets, dynamic, causal, multi-model, and multi-source methods.

His research focuses on utilizing spatiotemporal principles/patterns to optimize computing infrastructure to support science discoveries and engineering development. He has been funded as PI by multiple resources such as NSF and NASA with over $20M expenditures. He published over 300 papers, edited six books and 10+ special issues for international journals. His publications have been among the top five cited and read papers of IJDE and CEUS. His PNAS spatial computing definition paper was captured by Nobel Intent Blog in 2011. He has led several teams who impact GIScience profoundly. For example, he led a 3-member team who developed GeoServNet at Univ. of Calgary. The software was evolved into the core of GeoTango, which was purchased by Microsoft as the origin of Virtual Earth/Bing Maps. He furthers this innovation process by encouraging and creating startups with his students and collaborators. He has placed eight tenure line Professors in the U.S. and 15 Associate or Full Professors internationally including top GIScience departments such as Penn State, Univ. of Wisconsin- Madison, Arizona State, and Wuhan Univ. He also served in many public positions, such as the President of the CPGIS (2004-2005) and the chair of UCGIS research committee (2012-2014). He received multiple national and international awards, such as the Environment Stewardship Award in 2009 from President Obama. He founded NSF I/UCRC for spatiotemporal thinking, computing and applications with a group of international leaders from UCSB, Harvard, and GMU. The spatiotemporal innovation center receives over $2M/year research funding in collaboration with agencies and industry to build the national and international spatiotemporal infrastructure.

                                     <p class="mb-3 text-black"><font size="4"> Data streams satellites, phones, and other digital devices contain a wealth of information relevant to sustainability goals. Modern AI techniques have the potential to yield accurate, inexpensive, and highly scalable models to inform research, policy, and business decisions. A key challenge, however, is the lack of large quantities of labeled data that often characterize successful machine learning applications. In this talk, I will present approaches for learning useful spatio-temporal models in contexts where labeled training data is scarce or not available at all. I will show applications to predict key socio-eocnomic indicators, monitor agricultural productivity, map infrastructure access, predict population health measures in data poor areas, and discuss how these insights are being used to improve decisions on the ground.</font></p>

             <p class="mb-3 text-black"><font size="4">Global earth observations with constellation of more than 100 operational satellites are providing unprecedented spatiotemporal data coverage, which can be exploited to continuously monitor key resources. Earth is a dynamical system continually changing due to both natural and human induced factors.  Recent decade has witnessed major changes on the Earth, for example, deforestation, varying cropping and human settlement patterns, and crippling damages due to disasters. Monitoring this dynamic phenomenon is critical for human wellbeing. In this talk we will explore recent advances in AI and machine learning for monitoring natural and as well as man-made structures at regional and global scales. </font></p>

<p class="mb-3 text-black"><font size="4">4. Dr. Jack Cooper joined IARPA in October of 2020. In his current assignment as a Program Manager, Dr. Cooper focuses on areas of scientific research that include remote sensing, computer vision, trajectory analytics, and large-scale microsimulation. He is IARPA's Program Manager for three programs focused on automating and scaling the IC's ability to detect and characterize human activity in a variety of mediums. These programs are SMART, which seeks to automate the broad area search for a specific activity in satellite imagery; DIVA which aims to automatically find and prioritize activities of interest in massive volumes of security video; and HAYSTAC which will automatically identify anomalous activity by deeply modeling normal human movement in large-scale trajectory data.

Prior to joining IARPA, Dr. Cooper worked at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) in the Research Directorate, where he was a Senior Staff Scientist for Predictive Analytics. There Dr. Cooper created and executed significant programs to automate Motion GEOINT processing and analysis, resulting in the transfer of multiple analytics into operations in both NGA and IC Partner enterprises. During his time at NGA, Dr. Cooper also built research programs to prepare the agency for future satellite systems and data streams through field experiments, simulation, and creation of new processing algorithms and architectures.

Dr. Cooper graduated from Clemson University in 2012 with a Ph. D and Master's degree in Mathematical Sciences. He previously graduated from the University of Maryland in 2007 with a Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics and Government and Politics.</font></p>
